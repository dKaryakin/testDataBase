# testDataBase
Here is just SQL scripts for database creation.

What is so special about this database?
-
Literally nothing. But it is used in a service I've created (you can find it here https://github.com/dKaryakin/testServiceObject). And this service is just a test object and nothing more. Tests might be found here https://github.com/dKaryakin/BackendTestFrameworkExample.
